The strategy we are running in the arena is iterating through process id's and killing any that is 
not the calling process's thread, after we kill a process, we then fork. This does mean that we can kill ourselves
but the speed at which this method works means that we generally kill the other competitors completely. We set 
our loop of killing processes to 50 below the calling process' id in order to increase the likelihood
of killing an enemy that spawned before us while still maintaining speed. So far in the arena, we have beat
every test case with this strategy though against phalanx and sniper, phalanx will sometimes win as
we kill too many of our own processes. We tried exploring killing by group id, scanning through process ids
starting at 0, and searching through proc to find and kill other processes but these were not as effective.
We had an additional plan that in case these did not work, where we would try to either change permissions of the 
opponent's file so it could not execute or just delete it to win the best of 2 out of 3.
